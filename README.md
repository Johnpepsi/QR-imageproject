## QR-imageproject Documentation
I learned using NPM package.json and by implementing how to locate and install the right command in terminal.
I used my own Github profile link for users for them to be able to see the clickable link from the image.

# About the Project
* I applied the inquirer npm package to get user input
* Also had to use the qr-image npm package to turn the user entered URL into a QR Code image.
* Lastly, Created a txt file to save the user input using the native fs node module.
